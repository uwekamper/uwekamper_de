This website used to be generated by [Hyde](https://pypi.org/project/hyde/), a Python-based
static site generator. Hyde has since been abandoned (it still works with Python2 only) 
and anyway there are more advanced static site generators available today.

So I decided to redo this website using [Lektor](https://getlektor.com/).
