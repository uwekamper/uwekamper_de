Lately I talked to a number of people you just started programming. They all
lamented about how bad their code looks and how bad it works and that it's all just
a bunch of badly hacked-together lines of whatever programming language they used.
I found this is a great quote by radio host and producer [Ira Glass][3] that holds 
true for programming as well.

Now stop whining and do a lot of work and your code will soon look better than mine!
